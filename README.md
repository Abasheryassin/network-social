# Network Social

## Description

With social media playing a good and bad part in everyone's lives it interested me to figure out how all of the features of social media interact with one another. During this project, I learned how basic social media features can balloon the backend and complicate Schema relatively quickly. Using MongoDB and Mongoose seems very useful in order to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of social media.
